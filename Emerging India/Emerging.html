          <h1>The Emerging Market</h1>
          <p>The emerging markets are the developing nations that 
            have a crucial role to play in the global economy.
            The consistent GDP growth coupled with valuable investment
             opportunities is what makes any nation a contender for
             the same. India is one such emerging market! 
             It has prospered since the economic liberalization 
             in the 1960s. The concept of an emerging market is
              employed to evaluate the development of the countrie
               on the industrial and market front. This is because
                not only India is one of the hotspots for higher 
                education but it continues to be one of the fastest-
                growing economies of the world. The creative and
                 innovative minds nurtured by the Indian higher 
                 education institutions are the ones responsible for
                  conceptualizing the idea of start-ups.</p>
            <img src="emerging-market.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>The hands-on and analytical education imparted in the 
    institutes pushes students to think out-of-the-box and
     develop innovative thinking. As a result, the constantly
      thriving economic sectors like fintech, e-commerce, 
      pharmaceutical have garnered global attention. Apart from these
     booming sectors, India is making significant growth in the field
      of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. ...</p>
      <h1>Digitalization in India</h1>
      <p>The digital capability of India continues to surge at an 
        impressive rate. The increased availability of smartphones 
        and good internet connectivity, as well as penetration, has made 
        India home to more than 560 million internet users. This rapid
        growth in digital infrastructure has put it in the forefront in 
        terms of technological innovation. Be it the availability of 
        day-to-day services through mobile and online platforms or 
        cashless transactions, 
        India continues to achieve digital transformation in every field.
    </p>
    <img src="digitalization-india.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>The hands-on and easy to use applications are a perfect example of
         digitalization in India. For instance, domestic travels have
          become trouble-free with apps like Redbus (for buses) and IRCTC
           Rail Connect (for trains), payments have become cashless with 
           apps like PayTm, PhonePay, Razorpay, medicine delivery/ online
            doctor consultation/ online booking for lab tests is a few 
            clicks away with apps like Practo, Apollo Pharmacy or Netmeds, 
            search for accommodation in a new city is enabled through apps
             like Oyo, Nestaway or Housing.com and the food 
        cravings can be handled with apps like Zomato or Swiggy. ...</p>
        <h1>Start-up Hub</h1>
        <p>The increased internet penetration in every part of the country has paved the perfect path for a number of start-ups to rise, reach out to more people and address unique issues with their respective products and services. The perfect example is that of Paytm, a leading financial services company that provides payment and financial solutions. Founded by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the start-up initiated the digital revolution in the country and became India's leading payments app. Another notable example is that of OYO. An Indian start-up that has flourished globally and has made accommodation booking very convenient.</p>
        <img src="start-up-hub.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>With the constant support of the Start-up India initiative and the success of many start-ups, global investors continue to invest their trust in Indian companies and the investment is growing each year. In addition to this, the Government of India has introduced a handful of funding schemes to extend its support to the overall start-up ecosystem. Some of the sectors performing exceptionally well in the start-up ecosystem include fintech, EdTech, e-commerce and online gaming.</p>
